Lung Cancer Detection and Classification based on various Machine learning approaches. (OpenCv, Scipy,
ScikitLearn, Tensorflow, Keras): (Work in progress) Research oriented, image Processing Techniques like converting the
RGB image to grayscale image then applying Gaussian blur and image thresholding techniques like converting it into binary
image and extracting 13 features GLCM , Statistical features, shape features, Fractal dimension features. Then applying
Binary Classification Then Implementing various ML approaches to find Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve.
Tech: Python, ML (June ’23)
